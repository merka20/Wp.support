###  Description

Every business needs a customer service and support ticket system to clear up any doubts you may have when managing your website.

WP Support is a technical assistance plugin to be attended at all times by an expert developer who can provide solutions to the most frequent doubts of a company that manages its website in Word.

This allows users to submit tickets to report problems or get support on whatever they want directly through your WordPress website. When making a new ticket the user will do it from the support section of the administration menu. Once the ticket has been opened, an email will be sent to the developer to respond to the ticket. These actions will be displayed in the Plugin's administration panel and you will be able to see the question and answers at all times.

Main features of the advanced WordPress ticket system

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
